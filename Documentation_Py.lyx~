\begin_layout Abstract

\begin_layout Plain Layout
i.fusion.hpf
\end_layout

\end_inset

 is a GRASS-GIS module to combine high-resolution panchromatic data with
 lower resolution multispectral data, resulting in an output with both excellent
 detail and a realistic representation of original multispectral scene colors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
The process involves a convolution using a High Pass Filter (HPF) on the
 high resolution data, then combining this with the lower resolution multispectr
al data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Optionally, a linear histogram matching technique is performed in a way
 that matches the resulting Pan-Sharpened imaged to them statistical mean
 and standard deviation of the original multi-spectral image.

\begin_layout Itemize
HPFA outperforms anything I have seen so far (incl.
 Brovey, IHS, PCA) for Pan-Sharpening Multi-Spectral data.
 It simply Rocks!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The replication of the HPFA fusion technique in GRASS-GIS, as well as a
 "filter creation" bash one-liner, was Nikos Ve's idea.

Remarks
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
requires (currently) manual color rebalancing (e.g.
 by using i.colors.enhance)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
easy to use, i.e.: for one band i.fusion.hpf pan=Panchromatic msx=${Band} for
 multiple bands i.fusion.hpf pan=Panchromatic msx=Red,Green,Blue,NIR
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
easy to test various parameters that define the High-Pass filter’s kernel
 size and center value
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
should work with any kind of imagery (think of bitness)
