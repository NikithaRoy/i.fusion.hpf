`i.fusion.hpf` is a GRASS-GIS module to combine high-resolution 
panchromatic data with lower resolution multispectral data, resulting in an 
output with both excellent detail and a realistic representation of original 
multispectral scene colors.

The process involves a convolution using a High Pass Filter (HPF) on the high 
resolution data, then combining this with the lower resolution multispectral 
data.

Optionally, a linear histogram matching technique is performed in a way that 
matches the resulting Pan-Sharpened image to the statistical mean and standard 
deviation of the original multi-spectral image.

Algorithm description
=====================

1.  Computing ratio of low (Multi-Spectral) to high (Panchromatic) resolutions

2.  High Pass Filtering the Panchromatic Image

3.  Resampling MSx image to the higher resolution

4.  Adding weighted High-Pass-Filtered image (HPFi) to the upsampled MSx image

5.  Optionally, matching histogram of Pansharpened image to the one of the 
original MSx image

Step 1: HP Filtering of the High-resolution Image to Extract the Structural
Detail

Step 2: Adding the HP Filtered Image to Each Band of the Multispectral Image
Using a Standard Deviation-based Injection Model

Step 3: Linear Histogram Match to Adapt SD and Mean of the Merged Image Bands
to Those of the Original MS Image Bands
