ToDo
====

- Proper command history tracking. Not all "r" modules keep track. ?

- Add timestamps (r.timestamp)

- Deduplicate code where applicable

- ~~Implement function to clean temporary files~~

- Make the -v messages shorter, yet more informative (ie report center cell)

- Test. Will it compile in other systems?
