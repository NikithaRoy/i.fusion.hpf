#`i.fusion.hpf` is a GRASS-GIS module to combine high-resolution 
#panchromatic data with lower resolution multispectral data, resulting in an 
#output with both excellent detail and a realistic representation of original 
#multispectral scene colors.

#The process involves a convolution using a High Pass Filter (HPF) on the high 
#resolution data, then combining this with the lower resolution multispectral 
#data.

#Optionally, a linear histogram matching technique is performed in a way that 
#matches the resulting Pan-Sharpened imaged to them statistical mean and standard 
#deviation of the original multi-spectral image.
