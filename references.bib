  Abstract                 = {Pixel-level image fusion combines complementary image data, most commonly low spectral-high spatial resolution data with high spectral-low spatial resolution optical data. The presented study aims at refining and improving the High-Pass Filter Additive (HPFA) fusion method towards atunable and versatile, yet standardized image fusion tool. HPFA is an image fusion method in the spatial domain, which inserts structural and textural details of the higher resolution image into the lower resolution image, whose spectral properties are thereby largely retained. Using various input image pairs, workable sets of HPFA parameters have been derived with regard to high-pass filter properties and injection weights. Improvements are the standardization of the HPFA parameters over a wide range of image resolution ratios and the controlled trade-off between resulting image sharpness and spectral properties. The results are evaluated visually and by spectral and spatial metrics in comparison with wavelet-based image fusion results as a benchmark.},
