ToDo
====

- Use format() instead of the % operator

  Sources:
  - <http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000393/ch02.html#_solution_33>
  - <https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#formatspec>
  
- Proper command history tracking. Not all "r" modules keep track. ?

- Add timestamps (r.timestamp)

- Deduplicate code where applicable

- Implement function to clean temporary files

- Test. Will it compile in other systems?
